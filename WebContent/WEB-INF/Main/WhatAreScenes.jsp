		<h1>What's a Scene?</h1>

		<p>
			To understand what a Scene is, it is important to know that a game is
			made up of may <i>Scenes.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Example:</b> When you are playing a game and are on the first page
			of the game, this is the first "Scene" of the game.
		</p>
		<p>When you click on a button to go to the next page, you are
			requesting to go to the next "Scene".</p>

		<h1>What's a Path?</h1>

		<p>
			To understand what a Path is, it is important to know that all
			available options in a game are called <i>Paths.</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Example:</b> When you are playing a game and are on some page, you
			may have four options to choose from (four buttons to click.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Since each button would lead you to a different scene, on this page,
			you have four different <i>Paths</i> you could travel to.
		</p>
