			<h1>The Origin of The StoryTree Project</h1>
			<p>Some years ago, my nephews were bored. The elder nephew,
				twelve-years-old, started writing a story on a piece of
				paper.</p>

			<p>
				In the story, a monster was chasing my
				younger nephew, who came to a fork. He had the choice to go left or
				right.
			</p>

			<p>My older nephew clutched the piece of paper against his chest
				and asked what my younger nephew's choice would be...</p>

			<p>Their story would go on and on... and when it was
				time for them to go home, I asked if they would like to see their
				story turned into a computer game.</p>

			<p>The next time I saw them, they played a text-based game
				of their story that I had created. From then on, the kids themselves
				wanted to create their own games, but didn't have the 
				technical skills to do so.</p>

			<p>
				This story is the seed behind StoryTree. We aim to give young children
				an introductory tech. outlet to create their stories.
